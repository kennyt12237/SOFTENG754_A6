## How to run

### The application

- Run `./gradlew bootrun` in the terminal
- Open a new chrome window (currently, only chrome browser compatibility)
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/login`
- From there you should be able to use the app.

### The modules
#### Interactive Tool/Card Game - `http://localhost:8080/CardGame`
- Currently just a single player, simplified version of the game 'last card'. Use the buttons on the screen
  to play, and click on the help icon to see the rules.
- The page currently includes two testing elements. One will add a specified card to your hand. The other will add
  the specified card to the 'top' of the deck (the card that is being displayed). To use these, you MUST follow the 
  format specified on the page. Specifically, Cards can only be generated by inputting into the suit field
  (0 for Diamonds, 1 for Hearts, 2 for Clubs and 3 for Spades) and the value field (0-12, with 0 being Ace and 
  13 being King). 
- At this stage, the start game button is not used for anything.

### The tests

- Run `./gradlew cucumber' in the terminal

### Note

Please note that between some step definitions, there are similar but not reused steps. The reason for this was so 
that we could modularise the code which would be easier for a new developer to work on.

It was also so that we could add tags to some test cases, because they wouldn't work otherwise. Due to some issues 
between using drivers that were called in different step definitions within separate classes.
This would often lead to a NullPointerException causing the tests to fail unnecessarily.

Some issues that may be faced with this is that when adding new features, there might be duplicate step
definitions which would need to be different to any of the existing user stories.
